# **App Name**: CityTwinAI

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion: Collect and integrate urban (OpenStreetMap) and climate data (INMET, NASA POWER, Copernicus) into Firestore.
- Automated Data Updates: Implement Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler to periodically update data in Firestore automatically.
- Climate Impact Simulation: Use Python with ML (Scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to simulate the impact of floods, droughts, and heat islands. Store the models in Firebase Storage.
- Risk Prediction: Generate climate risk predictions for different regions using machine learning models. Save predictions to Firestore.
- Simulation API: Create an API (Cloud Functions or FastAPI) with endpoints for simulating climate scenarios (/simulate, /compare) to retrieve indicators, graphs, and heatmaps.
- Interactive Web Interface: Develop a web interface (Firebase Hosting) with interactive maps (Leaflet.js), graphs, and comparison dashboards to visualize environmental and urban indicators. Also enable Firebase Auth authentication for the website.
- AI Recommendations: Generate automated recommendations using a generative AI tool; for example: 'Building two retention basins in the West Sector reduces flood risk by 38%'.
- Automated Alerts: Send automatic high-risk alerts via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#43c6db) evokes the themes of weather data and advanced simulation. 
- Background color: Very light cyan (#e5f9ff) creates a clean, spacious feel.
- Accent color: Sea green (#20b2aa) is analogous to the primary, but gives important UI elements good contrast. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and highly readable interface.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent different climate risks and urban features.
- Design a clear, dashboard-style layout for presenting complex data and simulation results.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user interaction and provide feedback during simulations.
